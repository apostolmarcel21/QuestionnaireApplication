# Questionnaire Application


This application represent an exercise of using Java Swing combined with Java OOP concepts.
It is represented by a collection of java questions that one should answer.
Once the questionnaire is completed, it will calculate a score based on the correct/incorrect answers rates.

The _*Questionnaire Application*_ contains a few simple flows:
* displays a question and its possible answers, which can be checked 
* can be navigated forward and backward
* retains the answers previously answered (when navigated backward/forward)
* can be finished after completing the questions
* the final message is adapted to the score percentage
* displays correctly the score based on the no. of the correct answers responded 


Here are a few screenshots from the application navigation: 

In the above image it is displayed the panel with the question and possible answers.

After finishing the questionnaire, a message with *finish* button is presented.
It also displays a *back* button for the case one wants to reiterate over its answers.

In the last page is printed the score.
If the score is smaller than 50%, the message is written in red signaling that the test should be re-taken.
